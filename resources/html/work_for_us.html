<p>At the Washington Square News, we believe in doing great journalism and making great journalists. We hire people of all experience levels â€” from students with years of experience to those just starting out. We are a teaching newspaper; no matter what your skill is, there's probably a place for you at WSN.</p>

<p>We are looking for writers for our various departments, which cover: all things NYU, the city, state and national news, business, sports, music, theater, film, food, technology, the LGBT community and more. In addition, our opinion section is looking for columnists who can challenge our readers.</p>

<p>Our video desk is always looking for those interested in broadcast journalism and videography.</p>

<p>We're also looking for: photographers, copy editors and fact checkers, designers, illustrators and cartoonists, graphic designers and web programmers (particularly those familiar with HTML, CSS, Flash, PHP, Javascript or AJAX).</p>

<p>Not sure if we're for you? Stop by our offices at 7 East 12th Street, hear what we do, meet the editors and find out. Other questions? E-mail our deputy managing editor, Eric Platt, at eplatt@nyunews.com. </p>
