<p>Washington Square News, founded in 1973, is the free, award-winning student newspaper of New York University. All content is editorially independent from the university. WSN publishes every weekday during NYU's academic year, printing seven thousand copies Monday through Thursday and publishing online on Fridays. Our newspaper is distributed to more than 100 locations in Manhattan and reaches about 60,000 students, faculty, staff members and residents of our community.</p>

<p>Last year, WSN won two awards from the New York State Press Association: Best Columnist (Alvin Chang) and Best News Story (Marc Beja and Adam Playford). The latter also won Best In-Depth Reporting in the nation from the Society of Professional Journalists.</p>

<p>Washington Square News welcomes opinion pieces and articles relevant to the NYU community and written by students in it. We also welcome letters to the editor written by any member of the public in response to published articles or opinion pieces. Letters should be no less than 150 words. All submissions must be typed or e-mailed and must include the author's name, address and phone number. Members of the NYU community must include year and school or job title. WSN does not print unsigned letters or editorials. WSN reserves the right to reject any submission and edit accepted submissions in any and all ways. With the exception of the staff editorial, opinions expressed on the editorial pages are not necessarily those of WSN, and our publication of opinions is not an endorsement of them.</p>
